	This is the default localization file.
	The "id" attribute is how the launcher addresses each string internally.
	The inner text (between the <string>...</string> diamond brackets) is the actual string that will be shown to the user.
	
	To create a new line in inner text, you can either type in "\n" (ie "\n\n" for 2 new lines),
	or just press Enter to create a new line as usual. Both methods work.

TCU Project, 2025 [Est. {0}]
Created by {1}.

TCU is a community project that revives the online-only game "{12}" (2014) that was shut down in 2024.
*** The TCU Project and it's developers are not affiliated with the publisher {2} nor developer {3} in any way.

TCU Launcher (version {4}) is created by {1} and written in {5}, using {6} for the GUI.
External Libraries used:
* {7}, for displaying the main news page.
* {8}, for .7z archive support.

* Among original assets, some images, fonts and media are utilized from The Crew Fansite kit.
Thank you to {13} for adding support for Czech letters to the fonts!

TCU Launcher does not collect, store, or upload any of your personal data.
* Your launcher user settings are stored within the launcher installation directory.
* Downloads acquired via the TCU Launcher may be cached and stored temporarily in the "downloads" folder. If needed, they can be deleted manually or by pressing the "{9}" button in launcher settings.
* The Launcher may connect to the TCU Project's website ({10}) during startup and usage, to retrieve the latest news, launcher and TCU patch updates; no user data is sent/uploaded. You can always opt-out of this by enabling the "{11}" setting.

*** The TCU Launcher/Project does NOT help you acquire The Crew game files illegally!
